WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS BELOW. PLEASE REVIEW SECTION 13.</b></p>
      <p class="text">By registering for or using Proper, you agree to these Terms.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">1. Our services</h3>
      <p class="text">We issue unique phone numbers (<b>“Proper Numbers”</b>) to individuals and entities or their designees (collectively, <b>“Proper Leaders”</b>).
        Proper Leaders can use Proper to message with the individuals who have signed up to receive messages from their Proper Number (<b>“Proper Members”</b>)...</p>
      <p class="text">Proper Leaders can use Proper to message with the individuals who have signed up to receive messages from their Proper Number (<b>“Proper Members”</b>).</p>
      <p class="text">Please also read our <b><a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></b>, which describes how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use Proper.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">2. Eligibility to Use Proper</h3>
      <p class="text">If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to use Proper.

      <p class="text">If you are registering for Proper on behalf of an organization, then you are entering into these Terms on behalf of the organization, and you represent that you have the authority to bind the organization to these Terms.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">3. Our Messaging Policies</h3>
      <p class="text">You must not use Proper to transmit any content or data that is unlawful, that infringes any intellectual property rights, or that otherwise violates our <a href="privacy.html"><b>Acceptable Use Policy</b></a>.</p>
      <p class="text">Though we have no obligation to do so, we may access, review, block, or delete your messages at any time and for any reason, including (i) to provide and develop Proper, (ii) if we think your messages violate these Terms, and (iii) to comply with applicable law or any request or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">4. Terms for Proper Members</h3>
      <p class="text">To become a Proper Member, you must: (i) start a conversation with a Proper Leader (for example, by sending a text message to their Proper Number); (ii) provide certain information, such as your name, date of birth, gender identity, city, and phone number; and (iii) give prior express signed written consent to receive recurring messages (which may be marketing and/or automated) from or on behalf of the applicable Proper Leader via Proper. Your consent to receive such messages is not a condition of any purchase.</p>
      <p class="text">You agree that:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">we may send you account-related messages at the phone number you have provided to us;</li>
        <li class="list-item">each Proper Leader alone (and not [Official Company Name]) is responsible for determining whether and what messages are sent to you via their Proper Number and when those messages are sent (which may be at any time of day, including on weekends or holidays);</li>
        <li class="list-item">you are responsible for any messaging and data charges that you may incur when messaging with Proper Leaders or with us;</li>

        <li class="list-item">messages sent via Proper may contain links to third-party websites or apps, which may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices, and we are not responsible or liable for their content, products, or services (“<b>Third Party Materials</b>”);</li>
        <li class="list-item">you will use only your own phone number when messaging a Proper Leader (and if we discover that you did not use your own phone number, we may suspend or terminate your account access at any time); and</li>

      </ul>
      <p class="text">We have no control over and do not guarantee: (a) the suitability or legality of messages sent by Proper Leaders; (b) the truth or accuracy of messages sent by Proper Leaders; (c) the performance or conduct of Proper Leaders; or (d) who a Proper Leader permits to access and use Proper on their behalf. If you think a Proper Leader is sending messages in violation of our <b><a href="#">Acceptable Use Policy</a></b>, please email us at <a href="mailto:platform-integrity@proper.link" class="email-link">platform-integrity@proper.link</a>.</p>
      <p class="text">If you want to stop receiving messages from a particular Proper Leader, send a message that says STOP (case insensitive) to their Proper Number. For more information about our privacy practices (including information on how to stop receiving messages from all Proper Leaders), see our <b><a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></b>. You may also request assistance at any time by sending a message that says HELP (case insensitive) to any Proper Number or emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@proper.link" class="email-link">help@proper.link</a>.</p>
      <p class="text">By sending messages to a Proper Leader, you grant that Proper Leader (including individuals and entities working or affiliated with such Proper Leader) a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, and perpetual license to reproduce, distribute, display, publish, and otherwise use your messages in any way and for any purpose, and you grant us all of the same rights to use your messages for the purpose of operating, providing and improving Proper (such as to allow us to deliver your messages to the Proper Leader, and to store your messages on our servers).</p>
      <p class="text">You acknowledge and agree that (i) a Proper Leader may share your messages publicly (including for marketing purposes); (ii) you have no expectation of privacy with respect to messages you send to a Proper Leader; and (iii) we may collect, analyze and use your messages together with your information, including demographic and location information, on an aggregated, de-identified or anonymized basis together with the messages and information of others, for any purpose, including to improve, enhance, further develop and test Proper and any of our technology, to create and refine algorithms and other machine learning methods and processes, to identify and predict patterns and trends, and to train and refine machine learning or analytical models or engines.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">5. Terms for Proper Leaders</h3>
      <p class="text">If you are signing up as a Proper Leader, please also read our <b><a>Additional Terms for Proper Leaders</a></b>, which you are also agreeing to.</p>
      <p class="text">If you are signing up to use Proper on a Proper Leader’s behalf, you acknowledge that you may only use Proper with their permission and in ways that would be permitted by that Proper Leader (for example, messages you send on their behalf must not violate our <b><a href="privacy.html" class="email-link">Acceptable Use Policy</a></b>).</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">6. Restrictions</h3>
      <p class="text">We and our licensors retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Proper and all Proper Numbers.

      <p class="text">We welcome and encourage you to provide us with feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvements to Proper (<b>“Feedback“</b>). Any Feedback you submit to us will be owned by us and we may use and exploit that Feedback without restriction for any purpose, without compensation to you.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">7. Term & Termination</h3>
      <p class="text">You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by emailing us at us at <b><a href="mailto:accountservices@proper.link" class="email-link">accountservices@proper.link</a></b> and asking us to delete your Proper account, and we may suspend or disable your Proper account and/or terminate these Terms at any time, for any reason, without advance notice. If we suspend or disable your Proper account for a violation of these Terms, you must not create another Proper account without our permission.</p>
      <p class="text">Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and we continue to be bound by sections 3, 4, 6, and 9-16 of these Terms and, if you are a Proper Leader, by sections 6, 7, and 8 of our <b><a>Additional Terms for Proper Leaders</a></b>.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">8. Copyright Infringement</h3>
      <p class="text">If you believe that anything on Proper infringes a copyright that you own or control, please send us a written notice to the address or email below that meets the requirements set forth in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (<b>“DMCA”</b>).</p>

      <p class="text"><a href="mailto:copyright@proper.link" class="email-link">copyright@proper.link</a></p>
      <p class="text">Please note that if you knowingly give false, misleading, or inaccurate information regarding the existence of infringing content, we may suspend your account, and you may face other legal consequences.</p>
      <p class="text">If we have taken down any material or content that you believe should not have been removed, you can send us a written counter-notice by email to <a href="mailto:copyright@proper.link" class="email-link">copyright@proper.link</a>. Please be sure your counter-notice meets the DMCA requirements.</p>
      <p class="text">We may promptly terminate without notice the accounts of users who have been notified of infringing activity, including those who have had messages removed from Proper at least three times (<b>“Repeat Infringers”</b>). Repeat Infringers will not be tolerated.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">9. DISCLAIMERS</h3>
      <p class="text"><b>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</b></p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item"><b>Proper is provided “as is” and “as available” and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement;</b></li>

        <li class="list-item"><b>we take no responsibility and assume no liability for any messages that you, another user, or a third party send or receive via Proper.

      </ul>
      <h3 class="our_services">10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      <p class="text"><b>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our shareholders, employees, affiliates, licensors, agents, and suppliers (collectively, the “Affiliated Entities”) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, or multiple damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use Proper; (ii) the conduct or content of other users or third parties via Proper; or (iii) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your messages, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</b></p>
      <p class="text"><b>Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with Proper or any Third Party Materials is to stop using Proper.

      <h3 class="our_services">11. Indemnification</h3>
      <p class="text">To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold us and our Affiliated Entities harmless from any losses, including legal fees and expenses, that directly or indirectly result from (i) your messages; (ii) your use of Proper; (iii) your violation of any laws or regulations; (iv) third-party claims that you or someone using your password did something that, if true, would violate these Terms; (v) any misrepresentations made by you; or (vi) a breach of any representations or warranties you’ve made to us. We reserve the right to employ separate counsel and assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In such an event, you shall provide us with such cooperation as we reasonably request.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">12. Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p class="text">If you are a Proper user located in the United States or Canada, then section 13 below applies to you. Please also read that section carefully and completely. If you are not subject to section 13 below, then all disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship between us (including any communications between us), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory (<b>“Disputes”</b>), will be resolved exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California or a state court located in Los Angeles County in California, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such Disputes. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in our sole discretion, we may elect to resolve any Dispute we have with you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the Dispute.</p>
      <p class="text">The laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of California govern these Terms, as well as any Disputes, whether in court or arbitration, which might arise between us, without regard to conflict of law provisions, and regardless of your location.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">13. Arbitration</h3>
      <p class="text"><b>If you are a Proper user located in the United States or Canada, then this section 13 applies to you.</b></p>
      <p class="text"><b>Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship between us (including any communications between us), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. You agree that we are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters will be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.</b></p>
      <p class="text"><b>You agree that any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action.</b></p>
      <p class="text">The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by these Terms. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</a>. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other relevant circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the AAA or the arbitrator will determine the location.</p>
      <p class="text">The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
      <p class="text">You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at <a href="mailto:accountservices@proper.link" class="email-link">accountservices@proper.link</a> with your first name, last name, phone number, and address within 30 days of accepting this agreement to arbitrate, with a statement that you decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
      <p class="text">Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will prevent you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">14. Export Controls</h3>
      <p class="text">You are responsible for complying with United States export controls and for any violation of such controls, including any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports. You represent, warrant, and covenant that you are not: (i) located in, or a resident or a national of, any country subject to a U.S. government embargo or other restriction, or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country; or (ii) on any of the U.S. government lists of restricted end users.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">15. Changes to these Terms</h3>
      <p class="text">We may modify these Terms from time to time. When we update these Terms, we will revise the <i>“Last updated”</i> date above and post the new Terms on proper.link. Your continued use of Proper (including, without limitation, signing up to receive messages from an additional Proper Leader after an update) confirms your acceptance of the updates. If you do not agree to any update, you must stop using Proper. We may also modify or discontinue all or part of Proper at any time; or charge, modify, or waive any fees required to use Proper.</p>
      <h3 class="our_services">16. Other Terms</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">You use Proper at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations while doing so. We may limit Proper’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Unless a mutually executed agreement between us states otherwise, these Terms make up the entire agreement between us regarding Proper and supersede any prior agreements regarding the subject matter of these Terms.</li>
        <li class="list-item">These Terms do not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agent, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between us.</li>
        <li class="list-item">We notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_content-control_software_and_providers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_content-control_software_and_providers</a>.</li>
        <li class="list-item">All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us to any of our affiliates or in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our prior written consent.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Except as expressly set forth herein, there are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</li>
        <li class="list-item">If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</li>
        <li class="list-item">If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</li>
        <li class="list-item">These Terms are written in English (U.S.). Any translated version is provided solely for your convenience. To the extent any translated version of these Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</li>
